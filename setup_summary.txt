Setup Documentation for Bioinformatics Coursework Environment
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Installation of Miniconda:
   - Downloaded and installed Miniconda for macOS with Apple M1 chip from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.
   - Installed Miniconda using the Terminal:
     ```
     bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
     ```
   - Initialized Miniconda and refreshed the shell environment:
     ```
     source ~/.bash_profile
     ```

2. Setup of Visual Studio Code:
   - Downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/.
   - Installed the Python extension for Visual Studio Code to facilitate Python development and environment management.

3. Creation and Configuration of the Conda Environment:
   - Created a new Conda environment named 'omics_cw_env' with Python 3.9:
     ```
     conda create --name omics_cw_env python=3.9
     ```
   - Activated the newly created environment:
     ```
     conda activate omics_cw_env
     ```

4. Installation of Bioinformatics Tools:
   - Added Bioconda and Conda-Forge channels to ensure access to necessary bioinformatics tools:
     ```
     conda config --add channels bioconda
     conda config --add channels conda-forge
     conda config --set channel_priority strict
     ```
   - Attempted to install necessary bioinformatics tools (cutadapt, bowtie2, samtools, fastqc, multiqc, igv) within the 'omics_cw_env':
     ```
     conda install cutadapt bowtie2 samtools fastqc multiqc igv
     ```
   - Encountered issues with package availability for the macOS M1 architecture.

5. Troubleshooting and Alternative Solutions for macOS M1 Users:
   - Due to compatibility issues with macOS M1, some packages were not available via Conda. Used pip as an alternative method to install 'cutadapt':
     ```
     pip install cutadapt
     ```
   - Consideration for Mac M1 users: Packages may not always be available for ARM architecture. Alternative approaches such as setting up an x86_64 emulation environment using Rosetta or using pip can be necessary.

6. Documentation and Reproducibility:
   - Exported the detailed list of installed packages to ensure reproducibility and ease of environment setup on other machines:
     ```
     conda list --explicit > omics_cw-env.txt
     ```
   - This document ('setup_summary.txt') has been created to record the setup process, providing a clear and reproducible pathway for setting up the environment necessary for the OMICS coursework, with specific notes for macOS M1 users.
