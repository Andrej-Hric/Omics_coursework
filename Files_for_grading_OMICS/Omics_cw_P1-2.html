        <h1>Omics Coursework Part 1</h1>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Andrej Hric</p>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 27/07/2023</p>

        <p class="note">All files for grading Part 1 Markdown file and Part 2 R Markdown file and R shiny app (app.R) can be found on GitHub at <code>/Files_for_grading_OMICS</code></p>

        <p>All code for this coursework, along with further instructions and data, is available at my Git repository. Due to issues with hosting larger files (LSF) requiring additional storage space on GitHub, I chose to remove them for easier access. However, following the steps documented, they can be recreated.</p>
        <pre><code>Repository link: https://github.com/Andrej-Hric/Omics_coursework.git</code></pre>

        <h2>Practical Background Information</h2>
        <p>The practical session involving whole-genome sequencing data, the file <code>Negative.fq</code>, extracted using specific barcodes, exhibited poor mapping results compared to other samples like <code>Positive.fq</code>. The purpose of this coursework was to analyse and explain this poor performance using best practices in NGS data handling and alignment techniques.</p>

        <h2>Environment Setup</h2>
        <p>For Part 1 of the coursework I first installed Rosetta (as I am using non-Intel based MAC), conda and all packages required and suggested by the coursework instructions for Part 1.</p>
        <pre><code>softwareupdate --install-rosetta</code></pre>

        <p>Then I installed Conda, created an environment for this coursework and installed all packages required based on the coursework instructions.</p>
        <pre><code>conda init
conda create --name omics_cw_env python=3.9
conda activate omics_cw_env
conda install -c bioconda cutadapt bowtie2 samtools fastqc multiqc</code></pre>

        <p>I used conda and created new environment to ensure that there are no software dependencies conflict which I found to be issue originally when not using conda. Also having this specific environment I could call it whenever necessary in future.</p>

        <h2>Issues with Original Reads and Improving of the Mapping</h2>
        <p>I ran FastQC report on Negative.fq file which we want to analyze in detail from practical</p>
        <pre><code>cd input_data/p1/fastq
fastqc trimmed_Negative.fq</code></pre>
        <p>The report from the practical on Negative.fq only showed problems with 1. Per base sequence quality and 2. Per base N content shown below. The fastqc report showed issues with bp positions [1-6] and [56-59] which are the 5' and 3' ends of the reads. The N base content showed that these bases were classified as other than ACTG bases and labelled as N due to low confidence of the base being one of the four main bases.</p>

        <img src="https://github.com/Andrej-Hric/Omics_coursework/raw/main/images_html/trimmed_negative_fastq_images/per_base_quality.png" alt="Per Base Quality">
        <img src="https://github.com/Andrej-Hric/Omics_coursework/raw/main/images_html/trimmed_negative_fastq_images/per_base_n_content.png" alt="Per Base N Content">

        <p>Next I performed an alignment as in the practical with the same settings this was --end-to-end. However, this alignment failed as it was unable to find a match to the reference genome. This is why I assumed that this is due to the bases at positions [1-6] and [56-59] as indicated by the fastQC report so the first five on 5' and last four on 3' ends. I then also performed a local alignment instead which could be a solution however the alignment result ended up having 0.00% alignment rate.</p>

        <p>This is why I then performed another alignment however specifying start/end positions, effectively ignoring the end bp which caused the issue not being able to align with the reference genome. This showed that the new alignment was successfully aligned with the reference genome to a 99.97% alignment rate.</p>

        <p>This was quite a significant improvement compared to original 0.00% proving that the alignment problem was caused by the N base read calls.</p>

        <p>For all of this I used bowtie2 and commands shown below.</p>
        <pre><code>bowtie2 --end-to-end --all -x input/p1/genome/AFPN02.1_merge -q input/p1/fastq/trimmed_Negative.fq -S output/p1/Negative_local.sam >& output/p1/Negative_local_bowtie_output_statistics.txt</code></pre>
        <pre><code>bowtie2 --local --all -x input/p1/genome/AFPN02.1_merge -q input/p1/fastq/trimmed_Negative.fq -S output/p1/Negative_local.sam >& output/p1/Negative_local_bowtie_output_statistics.txt
# note : the original alignment txt file was overwritten as the results showed no alignment
# (can solve this by renaming the output file differently)

        <p>I then produced a new fastQC report as shown below. This Report now has high quality for all positions, compared to the previous fastQC of the untrimmed Negative.fq. Also, the summary.txt file provided when unzipping the fastQC file showed that all tests were passed. The fastQC report is shown below along with the summary.txt content</p>

        <p>With this information I could proceed to a new alignment as all information seemed correct up until this point.</p>

        <h2>Remapping Based on N Calls Being the Problem</h2>
        <p>To replicate the alignment score and prove my hypothesis I produced a new file trimming 5' and 3' ends and also all N calls, effectively to eliminate any issue causing bases.</p>
        <pre><code># remove all N calls and first 5 and last 4 positions

        <h2>FINAL Mapping Statistics</h2>
        <p>To get the mapping statistics I looked up samtools commands for this.</p>
        <pre><code># first I converted SAM files to BAM format for more efficient handling and processing as BAM file is smaller and faster and recommended to use for samtool

samtools view -bS output_data/p1/New_Negative_trim.sam | samtools sort -o output_data/p1/New_Negative_trim_sorted.bam 

# then to index the bam file 
samtools index output_data/p1/New_Negative_trim_sorted.bam

# after indexing the bam files, statistics can be extracted and we can look at alignment quality stats.
samtools stats output_data/p1/New_Negative_trim_sorted.bam > output_data/p1/New_Negative_trim_stats.txt

# flagstat analysis used as recommended by the coursework 
samtools flagstat output_data/p1/New_Negative_trim_sorted.bam > output_data/p1/New_Negative_trim_flagstats.txt

# lastly again as recommended I used MultiQC to summarize the statistics and generate a report, this should contain all data from quality control and alignment.
multiqc output_data/p1/ -o output_data/p1/multiqc_report</code></pre>

        <p>By doing this I could resolve the question why the original figure in the coursework, of Negative_bowtie_stats and Positive_bowtie_stats were different, and I ended up with exactly the same result of Negative_bowtie_stats as Positive_bowtie_stats in the original Bowtie 2 SE alignment scores. This is shown on the image below.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion of Coursework Part 1</h2>
        <p>In my genomic sequencing analysis, I initially attempted to align the reads using bowtie2 without preprocessing. This direct approach resulted in an alignment rate of 0%, which was quite disappointing. The FastQC analysis had already shown that the extremities of the reads were plagued with ‘N’ bases which are indicators that represent uncertainty in nucleotide identity. These ‘N’ bases, found primarily at the 5’ and 3’ ends, effectively hindered proper alignment to the reference genome, as they obscured the true biological sequences.</p>

        <p>Considering these challenges, I decided to implement a trimming strategy. I trimmed the first 5 bases from the 5’ end and the last 4 bases from the 3’ end of each read, targeting precisely those regions flagged by FastQC. I think this approach was necessary to get rid of the problematic bases which were causing misalignments. This adjustment improved the alignment rate to 99.97%. I consider the trimmed alignment method better and easier as when I removed these problem N sections, the reads aligned closely to the genome, demonstrating the substantial impact that even simple preprocessing steps can have on the quality and utility of NGS data. This experience has reinforced my belief in the critical role of preprocessing in enhancing the accuracy of genomic analyses.</p>

        <h2>Question iv) SRRM4 Expression Analysis</h2>
        <p>A) The code below produces a boxplot showing the normalized counts for the SRRM4 gene for all samples. This plot is also then compared against the original figure 7b from the reference paper by Irimia et al.</p>
        <p>B) In this case I used normalized counts for the gene expression comparison as raw counts from sequencing can have high variability and this could mislead me by not accurately reflecting the real differences between the samples either due to differences in sequencing depth or other factors.</p>
        <p>Using normalized counts adjust for this variability which makes it easier to compare across different samples and makes the data interpretation more clear.</p>

    <h2>Question v) Result Comparison to Original Paper for SRRM4 Gene</h2>
    <p>
        To look at the difference in SRRM4 expression between control and ASD groups, I used ANOVA (p = 0.178), 
        Kruskal-Wallis (p = 0.2987), and two Sample t-test (p = 0.18), all showing no significant difference (p > 0.05). 
        These p-values indicate that there is no detectable or significant differential expression between the two groups 
        as it's not statistically significant. However, the difference between my and the original paper's results might be 
        because they used more complex normalization methods and included additional covariates like sex, age, brain bank origin, RIN  
        and PCA components. They included these covariates in their model, whereas I only focused on gene expression 
        based on diagnosis, just as suggested by the original figure 7b, which might have been my oversight.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, they had a larger sample size and used more complex statistical techniques.
    </p>

        <h2>Question vi) Possible Improvements for future</h2>
        <p>Given that the samples originated from humans and differ biologically, and considering the variations observed in sequencing statistics, I could improve my method by incorporating additional covariates such as sex, age, RNA integrity number (RIN), and brain bank origin to account for confounding variables as they did in the original paper and this could improve the accuracy of the model by creating a multivariate regression model to account for all of these covariates at the same time.</p>
        <p>Next I could improve the readability of the data by removing low-quality samples and introducing quality control for this.</p>
        <p>Also, I could use the same more advanced normalization techniques as in the original paper, such as adjusted FPKMs via regression analysis, better accounts for sequencing depth and sample quality variability, increasing comparability. Increase the sample size as I said in the last answer in question v).</p>

        <h2>Question vii) R Shiny App</h2>

   I've noticed my Shiny app takes too long to start, especially when hosted on shinyapps.io, where it can't run properly because it exceeds the 60-second load time limit. To fix this I could follow these steps which I found after looking more into optimal R shiny app making however with my limited knowledge I did not apply these for deployment on the Shinnyapps.io platform.
   
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-compute results:</strong> I could run the data analyses before loading the app and just load these ready results when the app starts. This should speed up the start time a lot but also this might take too much time.</li>
        <li><strong>Load data as needed:</strong> Change the app so it only loads basic data at first and compute more detailed data can load later, only if users ask for it.</li>
        <li><strong>Break the app into parts:</strong> Organize the app into sections that work independently. This way, each part only loads its own data when it's actually used.</li>
